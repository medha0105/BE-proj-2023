Service Level Agreement
The project is service-oriented and the operational portion of the agreement between CCBL and Bidder will be in  the form of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA specifies the expected levels of service to be provided  by Bidder to CCBL. This expected level is also called the baseline. Any degradation in the performance of the  solution and services is subject to levying penalties as specified in the following sections. 
This section indicates the suggested SLA between CCBL and Bidder for the project. A set of parameters has 
been identified as key to the successful implementation of the Project. If the performance of Bidder in respect  of any parameter falls below the prescribed tolerance limit, a penalty is imposed for the breach. All the  payments to Bidder are linked to the compliance with the SLA metrics specified down in this section. During  the contract period, it is envisaged that there could be changes to the SLAs, in terms of addition, alteration or  deletion of certain parameters, based on mutual consent of both the parties i.e., CCBL and Bidder.
