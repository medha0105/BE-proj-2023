Bidder shall be liable for penalties for uptime maintained below 99.95% in a quarter. Bidder should  provide system generated availability report for each quarter. Uptime availability could be calculated as  below: 
 Uptime Availability in %= {(U – C )– D}/ (U – C) 
Refer to the below definitions of the parameters. 
Cancellation of Contract and Compensation:

Service Level Agreement
The project is service-oriented and the operational portion of the agreement between CCBL and Bidder will be in  the form of a Service Level Agreement (SLA). The SLA specifies the expected levels of service to be provided  by Bidder to CCBL. This expected level is also called the baseline. Any degradation in the performance of the  solution and services is subject to levying penalties as specified in the following sections. 
This section indicates the suggested SLA between CCBL and Bidder for the project. A set of parameters has 
been identified as key to the successful implementation of the Project. If the performance of Bidder in respect  of any parameter falls below the prescribed tolerance limit, a penalty is imposed for the breach. All the  payments to Bidder are linked to the compliance with the SLA metrics specified down in this section. During  the contract period, it is envisaged that there could be changes to the SLAs, in terms of addition, alteration or  deletion of certain parameters, based on mutual consent of both the parties i.e., CCBL and Bidder. 
This section describes the service levels to be established for the services offered by the Bidder. Bidder shall  monitor and maintain the stated service levels to provide quality service.  Penalties & Service Level Agreement 
Bidder shall have to enter into “Service Levels Agreement” with Bank covering all terms and conditions of this  tender while providing the service support and onsite/offsite support. Once go-live of application, the services  should be available on 365X24x7 basis and hence any technical problem should be resolved within 30 minutes  of  first  incident report.  
Bidder is expected to response and resolve issue within prescribed time frame based on the severity  description decided by Bank mentioned above and needs to strictly adhere to Server Level Agreement (SLA).  
The Bank would expect Bidder to commit to the service level assurances. Bidder shall commit to maintain  uptime of 99.95% and above per month.  
The SLA will be reviewed on a monthly basis. Penalties will be applicable due to downtime of software  application.  
Bidder shall guarantee 99.95% uptime required for Application, Switch services and DC & DR infrastructure  services. Bidder shall be liable for penalties for uptime maintained below 99.95% in a quarter. Bidder should  provide system generated availability report for each quarter. Uptime availability could be calculated as  below: 
 Uptime Availability in %= {(U – C )– D}/ (U – C)

If the performance of Bidder in respect  of any parameter falls below the prescribed tolerance limit, a penalty is imposed for the breach. All the  payments to Bidder are linked to the compliance with the SLA metrics specified down in this section. During  the contract period, it is envisaged that there could be changes to the SLAs, in terms of addition, alteration or  deletion of certain parameters, based on mutual consent of both the parties i.e., CCBL and Bidder. 
This section describes the service levels to be established for the services offered by the Bidder. Bidder shall  monitor and maintain the stated service levels to provide quality service.  Penalties & Service Level Agreement 
Bidder shall have to enter into “Service Levels Agreement” with Bank covering all terms and conditions of this  tender while providing the service support and onsite/offsite support. Once go-live of application, the services  should be available on 365X24x7 basis and hence any technical problem should be resolved within 30 minutes  of  first  incident report.  
Bidder is expected to response and resolve issue within prescribed time frame based on the severity  description decided by Bank mentioned above and needs to strictly adhere to Server Level Agreement (SLA).  
The Bank would expect Bidder to commit to the service level assurances. Bidder shall commit to maintain  uptime of 99.95% and above per month.  
The SLA will be reviewed on a monthly basis. Penalties will be applicable due to downtime of software  application.  
Bidder shall guarantee 99.95% uptime required for Application, Switch services and DC & DR infrastructure  services. Bidder shall be liable for penalties for uptime maintained below 99.95% in a quarter. Bidder should  provide system generated availability report for each quarter. Uptime availability could be calculated as  below: 
 Uptime Availability in %= {(U – C )– D}/ (U – C) 
Refer to the below definitions of the parameters. 
Cancellation of Contract and Compensation: 
The BANK reserves the right to cancel the contract of Bidder and recover expenditure incurred by the bank on  the following circumstances: -
